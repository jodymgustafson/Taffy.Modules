TypeScript modules library for creating web apps

This library contains a number of modules that I use when developing single page applications in TypeScript.

Hilights include:

* AudioClip - A class that wraps an audio element providing chainable methods and utils.
* AudioManager - Provides support for loading and caching audio elements.
* MultiChannelAudioClip - An audio clip with multiple channels so multiple instances can be played simultaneously.
* Collections/Map - A generic typed Map
* System module - Contains a number of functions and classes that make it easier to work with the JavaScript system.
* AppStorage - A wrapper over localstorage with generic typing and application namespacing
* Byte - A class for working with bytes (0-255)
* Color - Classes for working with rgba colors
* KeyCodes - An enumeration of JavaScript key codes for handling keyboard input
* UI/CanvasContext2D - A wrapper and chainable high level drawing methods for HTMLCanvasElement 2D context
